# odin-recipes
This current introduction is a basic HTML recipe website. A GitHub Repository will be made for it, by the end of this project there will be practice with HTML, git commands, to push, clone from GitHub, and save the work. This also gives opportunity to practice messages in commits. All of this would be used, and practiced, by the time the project was complete.
