# odin-recipes
This current introduction is a basic HTML recipe website. A GitHub Repository will be made for it, so there will always by the end of this be practice with HTML, git commands, to push, clone from GitHub, and save the work. This also gives opportunity to practice messages in commits. All of this would be used, and practiced, by the time the project was complete.
